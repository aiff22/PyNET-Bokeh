#### 1. Overview&nbsp; [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05698.pdf) [[Project Webpage]](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~ihnatova/pynet-bokeh.html) [[PyNET PyTorch]](https://github.com/aiff22/PyNET-PyTorch) 

This repository provides the implementation of the deep learning-based bokeh effect rendering approach presented in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05698.pdf). The  model  is  trained  to map the standard **narrow-aperture images** into shallow depth-of-field photos captured with a professional Canon 7D DSLR camera. The presented approach is camera independent, **does not require any special hardware**, and can also be applied to the existing images. More visual results of this method on the presented EBB! dataset and its comparison to the **Portrait Mode** of the *Google Pixel Camera* app can be found [here](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~ihnatova/pynet-bokeh.html#demo).

#### 2. Prerequisites

- Python: scipy, numpy, imageio and pillow packages
- [TensorFlow 1.x / 2.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) + [CUDA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
- Nvidia GPU

<br/>

#### 3. First steps

- Download the pre-trained [VGG-19 model](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/7z5bHNg5r5a0g7k) and put it into `vgg_pretrained/` folder.
- Download the pre-trained [PyNET model](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/ihnatova/public/ebb/PyNET_Bokeh_pretrained.zip) and put it into `models/original/` folder.
- Download the [EBB! dataset](http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~ihnatova/pynet-bokeh.html#dataset) and extract it into `ebb_dataset/` folder.    
  <sub>This folder should contain two subfolders: `train/` and `test/`</sub>

The proposed PyNET-based architecture has an inverted pyramidal shape and is processing the images at **seven different scales** (levels). The model is trained sequentially, starting from the lowest 7th layer, which allows to achieve good semantically-driven reconstruction results at smaller scales that are working with images of very low resolution and thus performing mostly global image manipulations. After the bottom layer is pre-trained, the same procedure is applied to the next level till the training is done on the original resolution. Since each higher level is getting **upscaled high-quality features** from the lower part of the model, it mainly learns to reconstruct the missing low-level details and refines the results. In this work, we additionally use two transposed convolutional layers on top of the main model (Levels 1, 2) that upsample the images to their target size.

<br/>

#### 5. Training the model

The model is trained level by level, starting from the lowest (7th) one:

```bash
python train_model.py level=<level>
```

Obligatory parameters:

>```level```: **```7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1```**

Optional parameters and their default values:

>```batch_size```: **```50```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; batch size [small values can lead to unstable training] <br/>
>```train_size```: **```4894```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; the number of training images randomly loaded each 1000 iterations <br/>
>```eval_step```: **```1000```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; each ```eval_step``` iterations the accuracy is computed and the model is saved <br/>
>```learning_rate```: **```5e-5```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; learning rate <br/>
>```restore_iter```: **```None```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; iteration to restore (when not specified, the last saved model for PyNET's ```level+1``` is loaded)<br/>
>```num_train_iters```: **```5K, 5K, 20K, 20K, 30K, 80K, 100K (for levels 5 - 0)```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; the number of training iterations <br/>
>```vgg_dir```: **```vgg_pretrained/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; path to the pre-trained VGG-19 network <br/>
>```dataset_dir```: **```ebb_dataset/```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; path to the folder with the **EBB! dataset** <br/>

</br>

Below we provide the commands used for training the model on the Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU with 16GB of RAM. When using GPUs with smaller amount of memory, the batch size and the number of training iterations should be adjusted accordingly:

```bash
python train_model.py level=7 batch_size=50 num_train_iters=5000
python train_model.py level=6 batch_size=50 num_train_iters=5000
python train_model.py level=5 batch_size=40 num_train_iters=20000
python train_model.py level=4 batch_size=14 num_train_iters=20000
python train_model.py level=3 batch_size=9 num_train_iters=30000
python train_model.py level=2 batch_size=9 num_train_iters=80000
python train_model.py level=1 batch_size=5 num_train_iters=100000
```

<br/>

#### 6. Test the provided pre-trained models on full-resolution test EBB! images

```bash
python test_model.py orig=true
```

Optional parameters:

>```use_gpu```: **```true```**,**```false```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; run the model on GPU or CPU <br/>
>```dataset_dir```: **```ebb_dataset/```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; path to the folder with the **EBB! dataset** <br/>

<br/>

#### 7. Validate the obtained model on full-resolution test EBB! images

```bash
python test_model.py
```
Optional parameters:

>```restore_iter```: **```None```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; iteration to restore (when not specified, the last saved model for level=```<level>``` is loaded)<br/>
>```use_gpu```: **```true```**,**```false```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; run the model on GPU or CPU <br/>
>```dataset_dir```: **```ebb_dataset/```** &nbsp; - &nbsp; path to the folder with the **EBB! dataset** <br/>
